    "excerpt": "Drawing up a Will is essential, but have you considered a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)? A real-life case study on estate planning.",
    "content": "While a Will takes effect after death, a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) allows someone to decide on your behalf while you are still alive but cannot do so yourself. In a recent case, our client was diagnosed with stage four cancer. He initially wanted to Will his HDB flat to his daughters to reimburse them for medical costs. However, we advised that an LPA was more appropriate. If he lost mental capacity during the sale process, his daughters could complete the sale to fund his hospice care immediately. An LPA enables family to manage affairs during life, while the Will handles asset distribution after death.",

    "excerpt": "Thinking of buying a business in Singapore? This guide covers revenue generation, brand reputation, and regulatory compliance.",
    "content": "Buying an existing business can save time and reduce risk compared to starting from scratch. Key advantages include faster revenue generation from an existing customer base, inheriting an established brand, and immediate compliance with Singapore's regulatory framework. Our guide walks you through finding opportunities in online marketplaces or via brokers, and the critical step of valuation using asset-based or income-based methods (DCF). Most importantly, we emphasize the necessity of rigorous due diligence on financials, ACRA records, and the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA).",

    "excerpt": "A complete guide for entrepreneurs on Sole Proprietorship, LLP, and Private Limited (Pte Ltd) structures.",
    "content": "Choosing the right legal structure impacts personal liability, tax commitments, and growth potential. A Sole Proprietorship is simplest but carries unlimited personal liability. A Partnership involves shared resources but risks for general partners. The Private Limited Company (Pte Ltd) remains the most popular choice for SMEs, offering limited liability, tax incentives (like the Startup Tax Exemption Scheme), and easier fundraising. For professional service firms, a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) blends the flexibility of a partnership with the protection of limited liability. Consider liability protection, tax efficiency, and long-term scalability before deciding.",

    "excerpt": "How a small family business escaped foreclosure and achieved a fixed monthly income of $4,500 through strategic refinancing.",
    "content": "Our client, running a 35-year-old family import-export business, faced foreclosure after missing $15,000 monthly loan repayments. Upon investigation, we found the client was 'over-securitized'—his properties were valued at $3.4 million against only $900k in debt. We negotiated with new bankers to refinance the high-interest overdraft loans into a new term loan secured by his residential property only. This reduced his monthly liability to just $2,500. Freed from the pressure, he sub-let his shophouse for $7,000/month, turning a near-bankruptcy into a $4,500 monthly surplus. Refinancing can drastically improve your quality of life.",
