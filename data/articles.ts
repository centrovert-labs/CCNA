    "content": "HE WANTS A WILL; HE NEEDS A LPA\n\nDrawing up a Will is essential, but have you considered a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)? A LPA might be more suitable in situations like the one below.\n\nMany people are familiar with drawing up a Will when planning for the future. A Will is a document that ensures their assets are distributed according to their wishes after they pass away. However, another legal tool that is often overlooked but can be just as important is a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA).\n\nWhile a Will takes effect after death, a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) allows someone to decide on your behalf. At the same time, you are still alive but cannot do so yourself.\n\nWe will dive into a real-life case and explore the importance of considering a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) alongside a Will and why the LPA may be the right choice for you and your loved ones.\n\nOur client was diagnosed with stage four cancer and was predicted only to have six months left to live. He wanted to draw up a Will before he became mentally incapable of doing so.\n\nOur client's daughters were his primary caretakers during this challenging period and were financing his medical needs. Our client wanted to reimburse his daughters for settling his medical bills. However, with only a HDB flat to his name, he could not reimburse them while still alive. As a result, our client decided to Will his HDB flat to his daughters.\n\nWhen our client and his daughters came to our office to sign his Will, he muttered: \"Remember to give the money to your brother.\". Upon hearing that, we immediately stopped him from signing his Will. We then explained to him that if he intended to give his assets to his son, we would make the necessary changes to the Will. The client quickly confirmed that he genuinely wanted to give his assets to his daughters.\n\nHaving sensed that something was amiss, we probed further. After much coaxing, the client finally relented. The client explained that he intended for the HDB flat to be sold upon his death; a portion of the sale proceeds would go to the daughters as reimbursement for the medical bills, and the remainder would be distributed to his son. Both daughters nodded their heads in agreement.\n\nUpon hearing that, we explained to the family that a more appropriate instrument would be a Lasting Power of Attorney.\n\nAs his doctors had suggested hospice care, the client could put the HDB flat up for sale. If he lost his mental capacity during the HDB sale process, his daughters would be able to complete the sale on his behalf. After that, the sale proceeds could be used for hospice care and other medical costs.\n\nThe Lasting Power of Attorney would enable the daughters to manage the father's affairs if the father lost mental capacity, whilst the Will would provide that the assets would be left to the son (as our client initially intended).\n\nOur client and his daughters were very pleased with our proposed solution since:-\n• The daughters would not incur further financial burden nor have the looming accusations of being unfilial for seeking reimbursement for medical costs since the father would be using his monies towards his medical costs;\n• The father was assured that his remaining assets would be given to his son.\n\nSpeak to us for advice on your Estate Planning Matters today!",

    "contentZh": "他想要立遗嘱；但他更需要持久授权书 (LPA)\n\n立遗嘱至关重要，但您是否考虑过持久授权书 (LPA)？在如下所述的情况下，LPA 可能更合适。\n\n许多人在规划未来时都熟悉立遗嘱。遗嘱是一份文件，可确保在他们去世后按照他们的意愿分配资产。然而，另一种经常被忽视但在法律上同样重要的工具是持久授权书 (LPA)。\n\n虽然遗嘱在去世后生效，但持久授权书 (LPA) 允许他人在您还活着但无法自己做决定时代表您做决定。\n\n我们将深入研究一个真实的案例，探讨在立遗嘱的同时考虑持久授权书 (LPA) 的重要性，以及为什么 LPA 可能是您和您所爱之人的正确选择。\n\n我们的客户被诊断出患有第四期癌症，预计只剩下六个月的生命。他想在自己失去精神行为能力之前立一份遗嘱。\n\n在这个充满挑战的时期，我们客户的女儿是他主要的照顾者，并资助他的医疗需求。我们的客户想偿还女儿们支付的医疗费用。然而，由于名下只有一套组屋，他在世时无法偿还她们。结果，我们的客户决定将他的组屋遗赠给他的女儿们。\n\n当我们的客户和他的女儿们来到我们办公室签署遗嘱时，他咕哝道：“记得把钱给你哥哥。”听到这话，我们立即阻止了他签署遗嘱。然后我们向他解释，如果是他打算将资产留给儿子，我们将对遗嘱进行必要的修改。客户很快确认他确实想把资产留给女儿们。\n\n感觉有些不对劲，我们进一步探究。经过一番劝说，客户终于松口了。客户解释说，他打算在去世后出售组屋；销售收益的一部分将作为医疗费用的偿还给女儿们，剩余部分将分给他的儿子。两个女儿都点头表示同意。\n\n听到这里，我们向这家人解释说，更合适的工具是持久授权书。\n\n由于医生建议进行临终关怀，客户可以将组屋挂牌出售。如果在出售组屋的过程中他失去了精神行为能力，他的女儿将能够代表他完成出售。之后，销售收益可用于临终关怀和其他医疗费用。\n\n持久授权书将使女儿们能够在父亲失去精神行为能力时管理父亲的事务，而遗嘱将规定资产留给儿子（正如我们需要最初打算的那样）。\n\n我们的客户和他的女儿们对我们提出的解决方案非常满意，因为：-\n• 女儿们不会承担进一步的经济负担，也不会因为寻求医疗费用的偿还而背负不孝的指责，因为父亲将用自己的钱支付医疗费用；\n• 父亲确信他剩余的资产将留给他的儿子。\n\n今天就联系我们就您的遗产规划事宜寻求建议！"

    "content": "HOW TO BUY A BUSINESS IN SINGAPORE - A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE\n\nAre you ready to take your entrepreneurial journey to the next level? Are you thinking of buying a business in Singapore but not sure where to start? Our comprehensive guide has you covered!\n\nWant to own a business in Singapore but don’t want to start from zero? Buying an existing business can save you time, reduce risk, and give you instant cash flow — if you do it right.\n\nIn Singapore’s dynamic economy, purchasing an established business is one of the smartest ways to enter entrepreneurship. Whether you’re a foreign investor, a local professional seeking independence, or an aspiring entrepreneur looking to skip the startup grind — buying a business offers faster revenue, proven systems, and built-in customer trust.\n\nBut navigating the legal, financial, and operational complexities of a business acquisition in Singapore requires more than just a good deal. This guide walks you through every critical step — from finding the right business to closing the deal and running it successfully.\n\nWhy Buy a Business in Singapore Instead of Starting From Scratch?\n\nStarting a business from scratch is exciting — but risky. In Singapore, where competition is fierce and regulations strict, buying an existing business gives you a powerful head start.\n\n• Faster Revenue Generation with Existing Customer Base\n\nUnlike a startup that typically requires a lengthy period, often months or even years, to develop a product or service, refine a business model, and ultimately build market traction and generate significant revenue, an acquired business offers a distinct advantage.\n\nAn established business comes with several key assets that enable much quicker operationalization and income generation:\n\nAn established client list: This means you inherit a pre-existing base of customers who are already familiar with the business's offerings and have a history of purchasing. This eliminates the need for extensive market research, lead generation, and brand-building efforts from scratch, significantly reducing the customer acquisition cost and time.\n\nRecurring revenue streams: Many acquired businesses, especially those in service, subscription, or essential goods sectors, have predictable and consistent income flowing in from ongoing contracts, subscriptions, or repeat purchases. This provides a stable financial foundation from day one, offering immediate cash flow and allowing for better financial forecasting and strategic planning.\n\nThis combination of pre-existing assets means you can bypass the arduous initial stages of business development and start generating income immediately. In many cases, new ownership can begin seeing returns and positive cash flow sometimes within days or weeks of the acquisition closing.\n\n• Established Brand and Reputation in Local Market\n\nWhen you buy a trusted business, you get instant benefits. People already know the business name & trust it because of good reviews and happy customers sharing their experiences online.\n\nThink of it like moving into a popular restaurant that everyone loves. You don't need to convince people to try it - they already want to eat there! The previous owner did the hard work of building a good reputation.\n\nToday most people find local businesses by searching online. They type things like \"best pizza place downtown\" or \"trusted car mechanic near me.\" If the business you're buying shows up in these searches, that's extremely valuable. It means customers can easily find you when they need your services. The business comes with everything - the building, equipment, and importantly, its online presence.\n\nInstead of starting from zero and slowly building trust you get a business that customers already believe in. This makes it much easier to keep making sales from day one.\n\n• Already Compliant with Singapore’s Regulatory Framework\n\nSingapore’s regulatory environment is world-class — but also complex. Starting a new business here takes careful planning & lots of paperwork. You'll need to register with ACRA, Singapore's main business authority, and keep sending them updated company information every year. If your business makes good money, you'll also need to deal with GST (sales tax).\n\nThis means learning when to charge it and how to report it properly. When hiring staff you must write clear job contracts that follow Singapore's worker protection laws. These cover things like vacation time & work schedules. Different types of businesses need special permits.\n\nYou immediately inherit a fully operational and legally compliant entity, which includes: -\n1. Valid ACRA registration\n2. Approved business licenses\n3. Established tax compliance history\n4. Already-opened bank accounts\n\nThis strategic acquisition approach enables you to avoid the costly mistakes frequently made by new entrepreneurs. These common pitfalls often include missing critical IRAS deadlines for tax submissions, which can lead to penalties and fines, or failing to timely renew essential business licenses, which can result in operational disruptions, legal repercussions, or even forced closure.\n\n• Access to Trained Staff and Operational Systems\n\nRunning a business isn’t just about ideas — it’s about processes. When you buy an existing business, you get:\n\n1. Ready-to-work Team : The business comes with trained workers who know their jobs well. They understand how everything works & know what customers want. These workers are valuable because they can keep the business running smoothly from day one.\n\n2. Supplier Connections: You get existing relationships with suppliers who provide materials & services. These suppliers already offer good prices and reliable delivery. You won't have to spend time finding new suppliers or building trust from zero.\n\n3. Business Assets: You receive everything the business owns including products ready to sell, equipment and machines, office furniture, computer programs, business permits, brand names and patents.\n\n4. Clear Work Instructions: The business has written guides that explain how to do every important task. These instructions help workers do their jobs the same way every time, which keeps quality high and customers happy.\n\nWhen you buy an existing business, you skip many of the hard parts of starting from scratch. Instead of building everything new, you can focus on making what's already working even better.\n\nWhere to Find Businesses for Sale in Singapore\n\nDiscovering the perfect business opportunity begins with a strategic search. Not all listings are equal — some are scams, others are underpriced gems.\n\n• Online Business Marketplaces\nExplore prominent platforms which provide robust filtering capabilities. Optimize your search by applying filters for industry, price range, location, and revenue. Specifically, look for businesses that offer:\n1. A minimum of two years' worth of financial records.\n2. Sellers prepared to disclose EBITDA or net profit statements.\n3. Listings that include photographs of the premises and equipment.\n\nTip: Listings lacking financial disclosures often indicate potential red flags and should generally be avoided.\n\n• Working with Business Brokers in Singapore\nA trusted broker offers more than just a list of options; they act as your strategic partner, ensuring a smooth and successful transaction.\n\nThey meticulously vet sellers and businesses, skillfully negotiate terms to secure the best outcome for you, and expertly guide you through deal structuring, such as determining an asset versus share purchase. Furthermore, they connect you with essential legal and accounting professionals, providing comprehensive support every step of the way.\n\n• Direct Outreach to Owners of Underperforming Businesses\nUnearthing exceptional opportunities often requires looking beyond conventional listings. Seek out: Businesses with poor online reviews but prime physical locations, establishments displaying “For Lease” signs yet still operational, or family-owned businesses whose proprietors are nearing retirement. A courteous phone call or email can go a long way; many owners, especially those feeling fatigued, aging, or overwhelmed, are open to a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nHow to Value a Business in Singapore – Key Methods Explained\n\nOverpaying can significantly diminish your Return on Investment, while underpaying often raises red flags. To help you navigate this, here are the three most dependable valuation methods commonly employed in Singapore:\n\n• Asset-Based Valuation: Book Value vs Market Value\nThis method is simple: Add up everything the business owns (assets) & subtract what it owes (debts). The result is called Net Asset Value (NAV).\nFormula: Total Assets - Total Debts = Net Asset Value\nThis approach is especially useful for asset-heavy industries such as manufacturing, logistics, construction, or equipment-based services (e.g., heavy machinery rental, specialized transport).\n\n• Income-Based Valuation: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)\nThe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method is the most sophisticated method for valuation. This looks at how much money the business will likely make in the future.\n\nYou'll need: - Past financial records (at least 2-3 years) - Tax returns - Realistic growth predictions\n\nThis approach is especially useful for:-\n1. Service-based businesses: Companies like consulting firms, marketing agencies, law firms, and other professional service providers, where physical assets are less significant than human capital and the ability to generate future earnings through client engagements, benefit greatly from DCF. Their value is largely tied to their ongoing ability to attract and retain clients and deliver services.\n2. Subscription models: Businesses with recurring revenue streams, such as media subscriptions, or membership services, are ideal candidates for DCF. The predictable nature of their cash flow generation makes future projections more reliable, allowing for a more accurate valuation.\n\n• Market-Based Valuation: Comparable Sales Analysis\nThe Market-Based Approach provides a comparison of similar businesses. This is like checking house prices in a neighborhood. You look at what similar businesses sold for recently and use that as a guide.\n\nWhen searching for “comparable business sales Singapore,” focus on the following:\n1. Business Type: Must be in the same specific field - Example: Don't just compare any food business - match a bubble tea shop with other bubble tea shops - This ensures you're comparing businesses that work the same way.\n2. Money Made: Look for businesses making similar amounts of money each year - Small businesses ($100,000-500,000) should be compared with others in that range - Bigger businesses should be matched with similar-sized ones.\n3. Location Matters: Singapore businesses in similar areas should be compared. A shop in Orchard Road will be different from one in Tampines - Consider rent costs and customer types in each area\n4. Staff Size: Match businesses with similar worker numbers - A 5-person shop is very different from a 50-person company - Staff size shows how complex the business is to run.\nRemember: Finding exact matches is rare but getting close on these points gives you a good idea of what your business might be worth.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Steps to Buy a Business in Singapore\n\nBuying a business in Singapore isn’t like buying a car. It’s a complex legal transaction requiring meticulous attention to every detail.\n\n• Conducting Due Diligence on Financials and Contracts\nWhen considering a business acquisition, particularly in a dynamic market like Singapore, thorough due diligence on financials and contracts is not merely a formality but an absolutely necessity - Due diligence is non-negotiable.\n\nKey areas of focus include:\nAudited Financial Statements (Last 3-5 Years): It's essential to request and carefully examine the last three to five years of audited financial statements, including the Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. These documents offer crucial independent verification of the company's financial health and performance.\n\nBank Statements Matching Reported Revenue and Expenses: Cross-referencing reported revenue figures in financial statements with actual bank deposits provides crucial validation. Similarly, scrutinize major expense categories against corresponding bank withdrawals. Any inconsistencies may signal weak financial oversight or, more seriously, fraudulent activities.\n\nAsset Verification and Valuation: For significant assets, particularly fixed assets and inventory, seek independent verification of their existence, condition, and fair market value. Ensure that depreciated values are reasonable and reflect actual wear and tear.\n\nCustomer Contracts: Scrutinize all significant customer contracts. Understand the duration of contracts, renewal clauses, pricing structures, and any specific performance obligations or penalties for non-compliance. Identify any clauses that could trigger termination upon a change of ownership.\n\nSupplier Agreements: Review key supplier contracts to ensure that essential supply chains can be maintained under the new ownership. Verify the terms, pricing, exclusivity clauses, and any volume commitments. Understand if these agreements are assignable and if a change of ownership could lead to renegotiation or termination of favorable terms.\n\nOutstanding Debts, Loans, and Credit Facilities Tied to the Business: Obtain a complete list of all outstanding debts, including bank loans, lines of credit, and any inter-company loans. Understand the terms, interest rates, repayment schedules, and any collateral pledged. Clarify whether these debts will be settled by the seller before acquisition, assumed by the buyer, or require refinancing.\n\nLitigation and Legal Disputes: Investigate any ongoing or pending litigation, regulatory inquiries, or past legal disputes that could pose a financial or reputational risk to the business.\n\nTip: Walk away if the seller refuse to provide any of the requested due diligence documents. The risk of acquiring unforeseen liabilities or misrepresented assets far outweighs any potential reward.\n\n• Verifying ACRA Records and Business Licenses\nBegin your due diligence by accessing the **Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) BizFile+ portal** (https://www.bizfile.gov.sg). This is the official and most authoritative source for corporate information in Singapore.\n\nOnce you locate the business profile, meticulously examine the following critical data points:\n1. Company Status: Confirm that the company's status is 'Active'. A status like 'Struck Off', 'In Liquidation', 'Dissolved', or 'Under Judicial Management' indicates severe operational issues or cessation, which should raise immediate red flags.\n2. Director and Shareholder Details: Verify the names of the directors and key shareholders.\n3. Annual Return Filings: Check the filing history of annual returns. Ensure that the company is up-to-date with its statutory filings. Non-compliance with annual return filings can indicate poor governance, potential financial distress, or even an inactive business that has not been properly dissolved.\n4. Principal Activities and Licensed Activities: Review the registered principal activities of the company. More importantly, check if the business has the necessary permits and licenses for the activities it purports to undertake. A discrepancy here can mean the business is operating outside its authorized scope.\n\n• Transferring Business Name, IP, and Domain Rights\nWhen acquiring a business, ensure that the following brand assets, if present, are formally transferred: a registered trademark, a website (e.g., .com.sg), social media accounts, and branded products or recipes.\n\nThis formal transfer should be executed through:\n1. Assignment Agreement - for trademarks and intellectual property,\n2. Domain transfer - completed via the registrar (like GoDaddy or Register.com),\n3. Social media access handover - which includes changing passwords and transferring ownership.\n\nTip: Never assume the seller will simply 'hand over' platforms like Facebook or Google My Business; you must officially change ownership.\n\n• Signing the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA)\nThe Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) serves as the foundational legal document for any business acquisition, functioning as your definitive legal bible throughout the transaction. Its meticulous construction is paramount, as it legally binds both parties and outlines every critical aspect of the deal.\n\nA well-drafted SPA must comprehensively detail the following key components:\nExact Assets Being Sold: A comprehensive and explicit list of all assets included in the sale is required. This encompasses both tangible assets, such as equipment, inventory, and furniture, and intangible assets, including patents, trademarks, brand names, customer data, and website domains. Each asset must be accompanied by a unique identifier or number, and a detailed inventory should be provided as an attachment.\n\nPrice Breakdown: This section should detail the total purchase price for all assets, specifying the initial upfront payment, subsequent payment due dates, and any agreed-upon payment plans or future earnings arrangements.\n\nRepresentations & Warranties from the Seller: This vital section offers critical protection for the buyer. \"Representations\" are factual statements made by the seller about the business at the moment the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) is signed. \"Warranties\" are assurances confirming the truthfulness of these statements and the existence of specific conditions. Should any representation or warranty later prove to be false, the buyer typically has the right to claim damages from the seller.\n\nNon-Compete Clause: This provision safeguards the buyer's investment and the value of the acquired business from direct competition by the seller post-acquisition. It legally prevents the seller from operating a similar business within a defined geographical area and for a specified duration after the sale. To be legally binding under Singaporean law, the scope, duration, and geographical limits of this non-compete clause must be reasonable and enforceable.\n\nTip: Given the complexity, financial implications, and legal intricacies of an SPA, it is imperative to engage an experience corporate lawyer within Singapore. Their expertise will ensure the SPA is robust, legally compliant, and effectively protects your interests.\n\nFinancing Your Business Acquisition in Singapore\n• Using Personal Savings or Family Funding\nFor smaller business acquisitions (typically under $300K), utilizing your personal savings or securing funds from family members presents a compelling financing option. This approach offers several distinct advantages:\n1. Interest-Free: Avoid the burden of interest payments, saving you significant costs over time.\n2. Autonomy: Maintain complete control over your business decisions without external lender interference or covenants.\n3. Expedited Closure: Streamline the acquisition process, leading to a much faster closing compared to traditional financing.\n\nTip: Understand that poor business performance could directly impact your personal finances. It's crucial to manage expectations and formalize agreements thoughtfully to safeguard family relationships from potential strain.\n\n• Applying for SME Loans from Banks\nConsider approaching local banks. The SME Business Acquisition Loans are readily offered by major financial institutions. These specialized loans are crafted to provide the essential capital for purchasing an existing business.\nTo qualify, you'll typically need a minimum of two years in operation, a reliable track record of cash flow, and an excellent credit standing for both yourself and your business.\nTypically, you can borrow up to 70% of the acquisition price, with annual interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 7.5%, repayable over 3 to 7 years.\nFor a seamless experience, we advise submitting your application early, as processing typically takes 4 to 8 weeks.\n\n• Government Grants and Schemes (Enterprise Singapore, Startup SG)\nSingapore offers support for business buyers. A cornerstone of this support is the Enterprise Financing Scheme (EFS), a comprehensive initiative spearheaded by the Singapore government.\n\nThe EFS is designed to provide critical financing assistance to eligible SMEs across a broad spectrum of industries, playing a vital role in their growth and operational stability. This includes key economic pillars such as the manufacturing sector, which encompasses everything from precision engineering to advanced materials; the diverse services sector, covering areas like information technology, professional services, tourism, and healthcare; and the construction sector, including infrastructure development and building projects.\n\nThe EFS typically offers various loan options, such as working capital loans to manage day-to-day operations, trade financing to facilitate international transactions, and fixed asset loans for purchasing essential equipment and property. These schemes are often underwritten by the government, reducing the risk for participating financial institutions and making it easier for SMEs to secure the necessary capital for expansion, innovation, and navigating economic fluctuations.\n\nPost-Acquisition Tips: How to Successfully Run Your New Business\nCongratulations — you bought the business. Now comes the real work.\n\n• Communicating Transparently with Employees and Customers\nAcquisitions can be unsettling for both employees and customers. To foster confidence and ensure a smooth transition, focus on swift, transparent communication and genuine appreciation.\n\nFor Your Team: Communicate Promptly & Assure Stability. Schedule a company-wide meeting within three days of the acquisition. Introduce yourself, outline your vision, and explicitly state that job security remains a top priority. Actively listen to their questions and address any concerns.\n\nFor Your Customers: Maintain Trust & Highlight Future Benefits Send a reassuring email immediately following the announcement. Confirm that the high quality of service they expect will be maintained. Share insights into upcoming improvements and enhancements. Consistently deliver on your commitments.\n\nTransparency and honesty from day one are crucial for retaining both your valuable employees and loyal customers long-term.\n\nTip: The more you share, the less people worry. Act fast, be clear, stay positive, show appreciation, and always keep your word.\n\n• Reviewing and Optimizing Operations & Systems\nSavvy business owners understand that continuous evaluation and improvement are key to maximizing a new acquisition's potential. Here's a focused look at areas to assess and enhance:\n1. Inventory Flow: Analyze the speed and efficiency of product movement, both incoming and outgoing.\n2. Staff Scheduling: Ensure optimal workforce allocation to meet operational demands.\n3. Supplier Costs: Review and negotiate your current agreements with suppliers.\n4. Software Efficiency: Determine if 'free' or legacy software solutions are inadvertently creating hidden costs or inefficiencies.\n\nTip: What was effective in the past may not be the most efficient approach today. Continuously seek innovative and improved operational strategies.\n\n• Building a Growth Plan: Marketing, Expansion, Digital Transformation\nWith stability achieved, the focus now shifts to strategic growth for your newly acquired Singaporean business.\n\nCrafting a robust growth plan requires a dynamic approach, integrating marketing innovation, market expansion, and digital evolution. A critical first step is to empower new business owners with a comprehensive digital marketing strategy. This plan will harness online platforms to significantly broaden your reach, incorporating tactics for engaging social media presence, strong search engine optimization (SEO), and precise targeted advertising to elevate brand visibility.\n\nExploring new geographical territories presents a powerful avenue for expansion, enabling access to untapped markets and diverse customer segments. Equally vital is embracing digital transformation; by integrating cutting-edge technologies, you can optimize operations and enrich customer interactions, all contributing to your overarching growth ambitions.\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid When Buying a Business in Singapore\nTo ensure a successful acquisition of a business in Singapore, astute buyers must proactively sidestep prevalent pitfalls that often culminate in substantial financial setbacks or intricate legal entanglements.\n\n• Skipping Due Diligence Because of “Too Good to Be True” Deals\nOne of the most critical errors is skipping due diligence, especially when presented with what seems like a “too good to be true” deal. This can lead to falling victim to scams, such as encountering a fake business for sale in Singapore. Thorough investigation is essential to verify the legitimacy of the business and to uncover any potential red flags.\n\n• Not Consulting a Lawyer Before Signing\nAnother mistake is neglecting to consult a lawyer before finalizing the purchase. Engaging a lawyer for business purchase in Singapore can help navigate legal complexities. Their expertise is invaluable in ensuring that all aspects of the transaction are sound.\n\n• Ignoring Hidden Liabilities (Tax Arrears, Pending Lawsuits)\nBuyers often overlook hidden liabilities, such as tax arrears or pending lawsuits, which can significantly impact the business's value. Failing to identify these undisclosed liabilities can lead to unexpected financial burdens, making it essential to conduct a thorough review of the business’s financial obligations.\n\n• Overestimating Your Ability to Manage an Unfamiliar Industry\nLastly, overestimating your ability to manage a business outside your expertise can lead to operational challenges and poor decision-making.

正面的客户评价 - 在本地搜索结果中的高排名 - 活跃的社交媒体账户 - 稳定的客户群\n\n与其从零开始慢慢建立信任，不如获得一家客户已经信任的企业。这使得从第一天起就更容易保持销售。\n\n• 已符合新加坡的监管框架\n\n新加坡的监管环境是世界级的——但也非常复杂。在这里开展新业务需要仔细规划和大量的文书工作。您需要在新加坡主要商业机构 ACRA 注册，并每年向他们发送更新的公司信息。如果您的企业赚了很多钱，您还需要处理 GST（销售税）。\n\n这意味着学习何时收取以及如何正确报告。在招聘员工时，您必须撰写符合新加坡工人保护法的明确工作合同。这些涵盖假期和工作时间表等内容。不同类型的企业需要特殊的许可证。\n\n例如，餐厅、商店和水疗中心都有自己的规则，必须通过检查才能保持营业。正确设置所有内容通常需要几个月的时间。您将花时间填写表格等待批准，并在需要时进行更改。这就是为什么有些人更喜欢购买现有企业——这可以让他们免于处理所有这些启动任务。\n\n您立即继承了一个全面运营且合规的实体，其中包括：-\n1. 有效的 ACRA 注册\n2. 批准的营业执照\n3. 既定的税务合规历史\n4. 已经开设的银行账户\n\n这种战略性收购方法使您能够避免新创业者经常犯的代价高昂的错误。这些常见的陷阱通常包括错过关键的 IRAS 提交税务截止日期（这可能导致处罚和罚款），或未能及时更新必要的营业执照（这可能导致运营中断、法律后果甚至强制关闭）。\n\n• 获得训练有素的员工和运营系统\n\n经营企业不仅仅是想法——它是关于流程的。当您购买现有企业时，您会得到：\n\n1. 准备就绪的团队：该企业拥有训练有素的工人，他们非常了解自己的工作。他们了解一切如何运作，知道客户想要什么。这些工人非常有价值，因为他们可以从第一天起就保持业务平稳运行。\n\n2. 供应商联系：您获得与提供材料和服务的供应商的现有关系。这些供应商已经提供优惠的价格和可靠的交付。您不必花时间寻找新供应商或从零开始建立信任。\n\n3. 商业资产：您收到企业拥有的一切，包括准备出售的产品、设备和机器、办公家具、计算机程序、营业执照、品牌名称和专利。\n\n4. 明确的工作说明：该企业有书面指南，解释如何执行每项重要任务。这些说明有助于工人每次都以相同的方式完成工作，从而保持高质量和客户满意度。\n\n当您购买现有企业时，您跳过了从头开始的许多困难部分。与其建立一切新的东西，您可以专注于让已经在运作的东西变得更好。\n\n在哪里可以找到新加坡待售企业\n\n发现完美的企业机会始于战略性搜索。并非所有的房源都是平等的——有些是骗局，有些是被低估的宝石。\n\n• 在线商业市场\n探索提供强大过滤功能的知名平台。通过应用行业、价格范围、位置和收入过滤器来优化您的搜索。具体来说，寻找提供以下内容的企业：\n1. 至少两年的财务记录。\n2. 愿意披露 EBITDA 或净利润报表的卖家。\n3. 该房源包含场所和设备的照片。\n\n提示：缺乏财务披露的房源通常表明存在潜在的危险信号，通常应避免。\n\n• 与新加坡的商业经纪人合作\n值得信赖的经纪人不仅仅提供一份选项清单；他们充当您的战略合作伙伴，确保交易顺利成功。\n\n他们仔细审查卖家和企业，熟练地谈判条款以为您争取最佳结果，并专业地指导您完成交易结构设计，例如确定资产购买还是股份购买。此外，他们还将您与重要的法律和会计专业人士联系起来，在每一步都提供全面的支持。\n\n• 直接联系表现不佳的企业主\n发掘特殊机会通常需要超越传统的房源。寻找：在线评价不佳但地理位置优越的企业、挂着“招租”牌子但仍在运营的场所，或其所有者即将退休的家族企业。一个礼貌的电话或电子邮件可能会有很大帮助；许多业主，尤其是那些感到疲惫、年迈或不知所措的业主，都愿意接受互惠互利的安排。\n\n如何评估新加坡企业的价值 – 关键方法解释\n\n出价过高会大大降低您的投资回报率，而出价过低往往会引起危险信号。为了帮助您解决这个问题，以下是新加坡最常用的三种最可靠的估值方法：\n\n• 基于资产的估值：账面价值与市场价值\n这种方法很简单：将企业拥有的一切（资产）加起来，减去它欠的一切（债务）。结果称为净资产价值 (NAV)。\n公式：总资产 - 总债务 = 净资产价值\n这种方法对于资产密集型行业特别有用，例如制造业、物流、建筑或基于设备的服务（例如重型机械租赁、专业运输）。\n\n• 基于收入的估值：贴现现金流 (DCF)\n贴现现金流 (DCF) 方法是最复杂的估值方法。这着眼于企业未来可能赚多少钱。\n\n您需要： - 过去的财务记录（至少 2-3 年） - 纳税申报表 - 现实的增长预测\n\n这种方法特别适用于：-\n1. 服务型企业：咨询公司、营销机构、律师事务所和其他专业服务提供商等公司，在这些公司中，实物资产不如人力资本重要，以及通过客户参与产生未来收益的能力，这些公司从 DCF 中受益匪浅。它们的价值在很大程度上取决于它们吸引和留住客户并提供服务的持续能力。\n2. 订阅模式：拥有经常性收入流的企业，例如媒体订阅或会员服务，是 DCF 的理想人选。其现金流产生的可预测性使得未来预测更加可靠，从而可以进行更准确的估值。\n\n• 基于市场的估值：可比销售分析\n基于市场的方法提供了类似企业的比较。这就像查看附近的房价。您查看类似企业最近的售价，并以此为指导。\n\n在搜索“新加坡可比企业销售”时，请关注以下几点：\n1. 业务类型：必须在同一特定领域 - 示例：不要只比较任何食品企业 - 将珍珠奶茶店与其他珍珠奶茶店匹配 - 这确保您比较的是以相同方式运作的企业。\n2. 赚钱能力：寻找每年赚钱金额相似的企业 - 小型企业（10 万 - 50 万美元）应与该范围内的其他企业进行比较 - 大型企业应与规模相似的企业进行匹配。\n3. 位置很重要：应比较类似地区的新加坡企业。乌节路的商店与淡滨尼的商店会有所不同 - 考虑每个地区的租金成本和客户类型\n4. 员工规模：匹配员工人数相似的企业 - 5 人商店与 50 人公司截然不同 - 员工规模显示了经营企业的复杂程度。\n请记住：找到完全匹配的情况很少见，但在这些点上接近可以让您很好地了解您的企业可能值多少钱。\n\n在新加坡购买企业的法律和监管步骤\n\n在新加坡购买企业不像买车。这是一项复杂的法律交易，需要对每个细节都一丝不苟。\n\n• 对财务和合同进行尽职调查\n在考虑收购企业时，尤其是在像新加坡这样充满活力的市场中，对财务和合同进行彻底的尽职调查不仅仅是一种形式，而且是绝对必要的——尽职调查是不容商量的。\n\n重点关注领域包括：\n经审计的财务报表（过去 3-5 年）：必须要求并仔细审查过去三到五年的经审计财务报表，包括损益表、资产负债表和现金流量表。这些文件为公司的财务健康状况和业绩提供了至关重要的独立验证。\n\n与报告的收入和支出相匹配的银行对账单：将财务报表中报告的收入数据与实际银行存款进行交叉引用提供了重要的验证。同样，仔细审查主要支出类别与相应的银行提款。任何不一致都可能表明财务监管薄弱，或者更严重的是欺诈活动。\n\n资产核实和估值：对于重要资产，特别是固定资产和库存，寻求对其存在、状况和公平市场价值的独立核实。确保折旧价值合理并反映实际磨损情况。\n\n客户合同：仔细审查所有重要的客户合同。了解合同期限、续约条款、定价结构以及任何具体的履约义务或违规处罚。确定任何可能在所有权变更时触发终止的条款。\n\n供应商协议：审查关键供应商合同，以确保在新的所有权下可以维持必要的供应链。核实条款、定价、排他性条款和任何数量承诺。了解这些协议是否可转让，以及所有权变更是否会导致重新谈判或终止优惠条款。\n\n与企业相关的未偿债务、贷款和信贷额度：获取所有未偿债务的完整清单，包括银行贷款、信贷额度以及任何公司间贷款。了解条款、利率、还款时间表以及质押的任何抵押品。澄清这些债务是否将在收购前由卖方结清，还是由买方承担，或需要再融资。\n\n诉讼和法律纠纷：调查任何正在进行的或未决的诉讼、监管查询或过去的法律纠纷，这些纠纷可能对企业构成财务或声誉风险。\n\n提示：如果卖方拒绝提供任何要求的尽职调查文件，请走开。收购不可预见负债或虚假资产的风险远远超过任何潜在回报。\n\n• 核实 ACRA 记录和营业执照\n通过访问 **会计与企业管制局 (ACRA) BizFile+ 门户网站** (https://www.bizfile.gov.sg) 开始您的尽职调查。这是新加坡最官方、最权威的企业信息来源。\n\n一旦找到企业简介，请仔细检查以下关键数据点：\n1. 公司状态：确认公司的状态为“活跃”。诸如“已注销”、“清算中”、“已解散”或“司法管理下”之类的状态表明存在严重的运营问题或停止，这应立即引起危险信号。\n2. 董事和股东详细信息：核实董事和主要股东的姓名。\n3. 年报备案：检查年报的备案历史。确保公司及时进行法定备案。不遵守年报备案可能表明治理不善、潜在的财务困境，甚至是没有正确解散的不活跃企业。\n4. 主要活动和许可活动：审查公司注册的主要活动。更重要的是，检查企业是否拥有从事其声称进行的活动所需的必要许可证和执照。这里的差异可能意味着企业在其授权范围之外运营。\n\n• 转让企业名称、知识产权和域名权\n在收购企业时，确保正式转让以下品牌资产（如果存在）：注册商标、网站（例如 .com.sg）、社交媒体账户和品牌产品或配方。\n\n这种正式转让应通过以下方式执行：\n1. 转让协议 - 用于商标和知识产权，\n2. 域名转让 - 通过注册商（如 GoDaddy 或 Register.com）完成，\n3. 社交媒体访问移交 - 包括更改密码和转让所有权。\n\n提示：永远不要假设卖方会简单地“移交”Facebook 或 Google 我的商家等平台；您必须正式更改所有权。\n\n• 签署买卖协议 (SPA)\n买卖协议 (SPA) 是任何企业收购的基础法律文件，在整个交易过程中充当您的最终法律宝典。其细致的构建至关重要，因为它对双方都具有法律约束力，并概述了交易的每个关键方面。\n\n一份起草良好的 SPA 必须详细说明以下关键组成部分：\n出售的确切资产：需要一份包含在销售中的所有资产的全面而明确的清单。这包括有形资产，如设备、库存和家具，以及无形资产，包括专利、商标、品牌名称、客户数据和网站域名。每项资产必须附有唯一的标识符或编号，并应提供一份详细的清单作为附件。\n\n价格明细：本节应详细说明所有资产的总购买价格，指明初始首付款、后续付款截止日期以及任何商定的付款计划或未来收益安排。\n\n卖方的陈述和保证：这一重要部分为买方提供了关键保护。“陈述”是卖方在签署买卖协议 (SPA) 时就企业做出的事实陈述。“保证”是确认这些陈述真实性和特定条件存在的保证。如果后来证明任何陈述或保证是虚假的，买方通常有权向卖方索赔。\n\n竞业禁止条款：该条款保护买方的投资和收购企业的价值免受卖方收购后直接竞争的影响。它在法律上阻止卖方在出售后的特定期限内在规定的地理区域内经营类似业务。要在新加坡法律下具有法律约束力，此竞业禁止条款的范围、期限和地理限制必须合理且可执行。\n\n提示：鉴于 SPA 的复杂性、财务影响和法律错综复杂，必须聘请一位经验丰富的新加坡企业律师。他们的专业知识将确保 SPA 稳健、合规，并有效保护您的利益。\n\n为您的新加坡企业收购融资\n• 使用个人储蓄或家庭资金\n对于较小的企业收购（通常低于 30 万美元），利用您的个人储蓄或从家庭成员那里获得资金是一种引人注目的融资选择。这种方法有几个明显的优势：\n1. 免息：避免利息支付的负担，随着时间的推移为您节省大量成本。\n2. 自主权：保持对自己业务决策的完全控制，不受外部贷款人的干涉或契约限制。\n3. 加速成交：简化收购流程，与传统融资相比，成交速度要快得多。\n\n提示：了解糟糕的业务表现可能会直接影响您的个人财务状况。至关重要的是要管理期望并深思熟虑地正式达成协议，以保护家庭关系免受潜在的压力。\n\n• 申请银行的中小企业贷款\n考虑联系当地银行。主要金融机构随时提供中小企业商业收购贷款。这些专业贷款旨在为购买现有企业提供必要的资金。\n要获得资格，您通常需要至少运营两年，拥有可靠的现金流记录，并且您自己和您的企业都拥有良好的信用状况。\n通常，您可以借入高达收购价格 70% 的资金，年利率在 4.5% 到 7.5% 之间，还款期为 3 到 7 年。\n为了获得无缝体验，我们建议您尽早提交申请，因为处理通常需要 4 到 8 周。\n\n• 政府补助和计划（新加坡企业发展局、Startup SG）\n新加坡为企业买家提供支持。这种支持的基石是企业融资计划 (EFS)，这是由新加坡政府牵头的一项综合举措。\n\nEFS 旨在为各行各业的合格中小企业提供关键的融资援助，在其增长和运营稳定性方面发挥着至关重要的作用。这包括关键的经济支柱，例如涵盖从精密工程到先进材料的制造业；涵盖信息技术、专业服务、旅游和医疗保健等领域的多元化服务业；以及包括基础设施开发和建筑项目的建筑业。\n\nEFS 通常提供各种贷款选择，例如用于管理日常运营的营运资金贷款、促进国际交易的贸易融资以及用于购买必要设备和财产的固定资产贷款。这些计划通常由政府承保，从而降低了参与金融机构的风险，并使中小企业更容易获得扩张、创新和应对经济波动所需的资金。\n\n收购后提示：如何成功经营您的新企业\n恭喜——您买下了这家企业。现在真正的工作来了。\n\n• 与员工和客户进行透明沟通\n收购对于员工和客户来说都可能令人不安。为了建立信心并确保平稳过渡，请专注于迅速、透明的沟通和真诚的感谢。\n\n对于您的团队：及时沟通并确保稳定。在收购后的三天内安排一次全公司会议。介绍您自己，概述您的愿景，并明确声明工作保障仍然是重中之重。积极倾听他们的问题并确解决任何疑虑。\n\n对于您的客户：保持信任并强调未来利益 在宣布之后立即发送一封令人放心的电子邮件。确认他们期望的高质量服务将得到维持。分享对即将到来的改进和增强的见解。始终如一地兑现您的承诺。\n\n从第一天起保持透明和诚实对于长期留住您宝贵的员工和忠诚的客户至关重要。\n\n提示：您分享的越多，人们担心的就越少。行动要快，表达要清晰，保持积极，表达感谢，并始终信守诺言。\n\n• 审查和优化运营与系统\n精明的企业主明白，持续评估和改进是最大化新收购潜力的关键。以下是需要评估和增强的重点领域：\n1. 库存流：分析产品进出的速度和效率。\n2. 员工排班：确保最佳劳动力分配以满足运营需求。\n3. 供应商成本：审查并协商您目前与供应商的协议。\n4. 软件效率：确定“免费”或旧版软件解决方案是否无意中造成了隐性成本或效率低下。\n\n提示：过去有效的方法在今天可能不是最有效的方法。不断寻求创新和改进的运营策略。\n\n• 制定增长计划：营销、扩张、数字化转型\n在实现稳定后，现在的重点转向您新收购的新加坡企业的战略增长。\n\n制定稳健的增长计划需要一种动态方法，整合营销创新、市场扩张和数字化演变。关键的第一步是为新企业主提供全面的数字营销策略。该计划将利用在线平台显着扩大您的覆盖范围，结合引人入胜的社交媒体存在、强大的搜索引擎优化 (SEO) 和精确的定向广告来提升品牌知名度。\n\n探索新的地理区域为扩张提供了强大的途径，通过它可以进入未开发的市场和多样化的客户群。同样重要的是拥抱数字化转型；通过整合尖端技术，您可以优化运营并丰富客户互动，所有这些都有助于实现您的总体增长雄心。\n\n在新加坡购买企业时要避免的常见错误\n为了确保在新加坡成功收购企业，精明的买家必须主动避开普遍存在的陷阱，这些陷阱往往会导致巨大的财务挫折或复杂的法律纠纷。\n\n• 因为“好得令人难以置信”的交易而跳过尽职调查\n最严重的错误之一是跳过尽职调查，尤其是当遇到看似“好得令人难以置信”的交易时。这可能会导致成为骗局的受害者，例如遇到新加坡待售的假企业。彻底调查对于核实企业的合法性并发现任何潜在的危险信号至关重要。\n\n• 在签署之前不咨询律师\n另一个错误是在完成购买之前忽略咨询律师。聘请新加坡企业购买律师可以帮助解决法律复杂问题。他们的专业知识对于确保交易的所有方面都稳健无误至关重要。\n\n• 忽视隐性负债（欠税、未决诉讼）\n买家经常忽视隐性负债，例如欠税或未决诉讼，这可能会极大地影响企业的价值。未能识别这些未披露的负债可能会导致意想不到的财务负担，因此必须对企业的财务义务进行彻底审查。\n\n• 高估您管理不熟悉行业的能力\n最后，高估您管理专业领域之外企业的能力可能会导致运营挑战和决策失误。至关重要的是评估您的技能和知识与您正在考虑的企业行业的关系，因为这会极大地影响您的投资成功。\n\n常见问题解答 (FAQ)\n\nQ1. 人们在新加坡购买企业时犯的第一大错误是什么？\nA1. 跳过尽职调查。人们爱上了这个想法——地点、品牌、生活方式——而忽略了数字。\n\nQ2. 如果我购买一家企业，我需要注册一家新公司吗？\nA2. • 如果您只购买资产 → 您可以在自己现有的公司下运营或注册一家新的独资企业。\n• 如果您购买股份 → 现有公司继续存在——您只是成为所有者。\n\nQ3. 外国人可以在新加坡购买企业吗？\nA3. 可以。外国人可以拥有新加坡大多数企业 100% 的股份。报纸或银行等某些行业有限制。\n\nQ4. 我需要就业准证才能经营我在新加坡购买的企业吗？\nA4. 这取决于您的所有权角色：\n• 如果您只是股东（不参与日常运营）→ 不需要 EP。\n• 如果您积极管理企业 → 您需要就业准证 (EP) 或创业准证 (EntrePass)。\n• 就业准证：需要至少 5,000 美元（或科技职位 5,500 美元）的固定月薪，相关资格。\n• 创业准证：适用于具有增长潜力的创新型初创企业或企业；没有最低工资要求，但需要商业计划和资金证明。\n\nQ5. 在新加坡购买一家企业需要多长时间？\nA5. 时间表因复杂程度而异：\n- 寻找合适的企业 1–6 个月\n- 尽职调查 2–4 周\n- 谈判和 SPA 起草 2–6 周\n- 融资批准（银行贷款） 3–8 周\n- ACRA + IRAS + 许可证转让 1–3 周\n- 总平均时间：3–5 个月\n\nQ6. 在新加坡购买企业有税收吗？\nA6. • 印花税：股份转让征收 0.2%（除非涉及土地/建筑物，否则资产购买不征收印花税）。\n• GST：如果您购买应税商品/服务作为资产出售的一部分（例如，库存、设备），则适用。\n• 预扣税：仅当卖方为非居民且出售股份时——对于中小企业来说很少见。\n• 企业所得税：收购后，利润按 17% 征税（新公司享有部分豁免）。\n\nQ7. 在新加坡购买企业需要律师吗？\nA7. 绝对需要。专门从事并购的企业律师可确保：\n• 买卖协议保护您\n• 明确排除负债\n• 知识产权得到正确转让\n• 竞业禁止条款具有法律约束力\n• 正确处理 ACRA 和 IRAS 备案\n\nQ8. 购买特许经营权比购买独立企业好吗？\nA8. 特许经营权的优点：\n• 经过验证的系统\n• 品牌知名度\n• 培训和支持\n• 提供营销材料\n特许经营权的缺点：\n• 更高的前期成本\n• 持续的特许权使用费（收入的 5-10%）\n• 对运营的控制较少\n独立企业的优点：\n• 更多创新自由\n• 费用更低\n• 独特的品牌\n独立企业的缺点：\n• 没有内置支持\n• 学习曲线更陡峭\n\n提示：如果您是新手，请选择特许经营权。如果您想要创意控制权和更高的长期回报，请选择独立企业。\n\n恭喜您迈出了创业成功的第一步！有了这份综合指南，您现在具备了在新加坡驾驭复杂的购买企业流程的知识和专业知识。从了解法律框架到识别正确的机会，我们已经涵盖了所有内容。\n\n当您踏上这段激动人心的旅程时，请记住保持专注、坚持和知情。有了正确的策略和心态，您的新业务很快就会繁荣昌盛。\n\n您想购买一家企业吗？立即联系我们开始吧。"

    "excerpt": "How a small family business escaped foreclosure and achieved a fixed monthly income of $4,500 through strategic refinancing.",
    "content": "From the brink of bankruptcy action, our client now enjoys a fixed monthly income …\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\nThe client runs a small family business importing and exporting goods from neighbouring ASEAN countries. It has been doing this for 35 years. Being old school, he runs his business based on relationships and personal ties. He has used the same bank for all his financial needs over the last 45 years. Conservative in his borrowing, he has one commercial loan secured by a mortgage over his shop house and a renovation loan (surprisingly, this was in the form of an overdraft facility) secured by his home.\n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\nDuring the economic slowdown, his business took a hit, and cash flow became a problem. The client started to miss loan repayment instalments, which amounted to $15,000 per month, and he paid them intermittently whenever he could. Each month, he struggled to raise the funds required to pay the loan instalments, which were overdue. Snowballing default interest became impossible, overshadowing his anxiety over his failing business.\n\nWHY HE CAME TO SEE US\n\nBy the time he came to see us, he had received a letter of demand from his bank. They had threatened to foreclose on both loans. In addition, the bank's employee, who had served as his relationship manager over the last twenty years, had recently left the bank. The new relationship manager taking over his account was not sympathetic - \"new brooms sweep client,\" as the saying goes - the new manager's prevailing concern was to reduce the bank's exposure in a recession.\n\nHaving been backed into a corner and feeling overwhelmed, the client came to see us, not expecting any more in terms of legal services than to help him \"buy\" some time with the bank. Yet, at the same time, he was desperately looking for ways to raise the funds to stave off the repossession of his family home.\n\nWHAT WE ACHIEVED\n\nA quick investigation of our client's borrowing history and current property valuations showed that –\n1. his residential property is valued at $2.3 million, and his shophouse is valued at $1.1 million (current valuations).\n2. the client's total debt to the bank is $900k, a mere fraction of the total worth of the mortgaged properties - our client was over-securitized!\n\nWe called our bankers, and within a few days, they offered to refinance his loan by giving him a NEW term loan secured by his residential property only.\n\nAs residential term loans bear much lower interest rates than overdraft loans, the client's liability to his new bankers was now reduced to a manageable $2,500 per month.\n\nOur client was so relieved and heartened by his status change that he could now focus on his business. To help him ride out the recession, he was able to sub-let his shophouse for $7,000 per month.\n\nAs a result, from the brink of bankruptcy action, our client now enjoys a fixed monthly income of $4,500!\n\nRefinancing will help you reduce your monthly repayments and improve your quality of life.",

    "contentZh": "从濒临破产的境地，我们的客户现在享有固定的月收入……\n\n背景\n\n客户经营着一家小型家族企业，从邻近的东盟国家进出口商品。这项业务已经经营了 35 年。作为一个老派的人，他的生意建立在关系和私人纽带之上。在过去的 45 年里，他的所有财务需求都使用同一家银行。他在借贷方面很保守，有一笔以店屋为抵押的商业贷款，以及一笔以房屋为抵押的装修贷款（令人惊讶的是，这是一种透支形式）。\n\n问题\n\n在经济放缓期间，他的生意受到了冲击，现金流出现了问题。客户开始拖欠每月 15,000 美元的贷款分期付款，只能断断续续地偿还。每个月，他都在努力筹集资金支付逾期的贷款分期付款。滚雪球般的违约利息变得难以承受，掩盖了他对生意失败的焦虑。\n\n他为什么来找我们\n\n当他来找我们时，已经收到了银行的催款信。银行威胁要取消这两笔贷款的抵押品赎回权。此外，过去二十年一直担任通过客户经理的银行员工最近离职了。接管他账户的新客户经理并不同情——俗话说“新官上任三把火”——新经理的主要关注点可以减少银行在经济衰退中的风险敞口。\n\n被逼入绝境且感到不知所措的客户来找我们，并不指望我们能提供什么法律服务，只是希望能帮他向银行“争取”一些时间。然而，与此同时，通过他也在拼命寻找筹集资金的方法，以避免家庭住房被收回。\n\n我们取得的成果\n\n对各户借贷历史和当前房产估值的快速调查显示：\n1. 他的住宅房产估值为 230 万美元，店屋估值为 110 万美元（当前估值）。\n2. 客户欠银行的总债务为 90 万美元，仅占抵押房产总价值的一小部分——我们的客户被过度证券化了！\n\n我们联系了我们的银行家，几天之内，他们提出通过为他提供仅以其住宅房产为抵押的新定期贷款来为他的贷款再融资。\n\n由于住宅定期贷款的利率远低于透支贷款，客户对新银行家的负债现在减少到了可控的每月 2,500 美元。\n\n客户对自己的状况变化感到非常欣慰和振奋，他现在可以专注于自己的生意了。为了帮助他度过经济衰退，他得以以每月 7,000 美元的价格转租了他的店屋。\n\n结果，从濒临破产的境地，我们的客户现在享有每月 4,500 美元的固定收入！\n\n再融资将帮助您减少每月还款额并提高生活质量。"
